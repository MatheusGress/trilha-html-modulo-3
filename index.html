            <p><b>Deadpool & Wolverine</b> is a 2024 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the
                characters Deadpool and Wolverine. Produced by Marvel Studios, Maximum Effort, and 21 Laps
                Entertainment, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 34th film in the Marvel
                Cinematic Universe (MCU) and the sequel to Deadpool (2016) and Deadpool 2 (2018). The film was directed
                by Shawn Levy from a screenplay he wrote with Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells.
                Reynolds and Hugh Jackman respectively star as Wade Wilson / Deadpool and Logan / Wolverine, alongside
                Emma Corrin, Morena Baccarin, Rob Delaney, Leslie Uggams, Aaron Stanford, and Matthew Macfadyen. In the
                film, Deadpool learns that the Time Variance Authority plans to destroy his universe and works with a
                reluctant Wolverine from another universe to stop them.</p>

            <p>Development on a third Deadpool film began at 20th Century Fox by November 2016, but was placed on hold
                after the studio was acquired by Disney in March 2019. Control of the character and Fox's X-Men film
                series was transferred to Marvel Studios, which began developing a new film with Reynolds. It integrates
                Deadpool with the MCU and retains the R rating of the previous Deadpool films, a first for the MCU.
                Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin joined in November 2020 as writers. Reese and Wernick
                returned from the previous films for rewrites by March 2022, when Levy was hired as director. They,
                along with Reynolds and Wells, had difficulty figuring out the film's story until Jackman decided to
                reprise his role as Wolverine from the X-Men films in August 2022. Several other actors from the X-Men
                films and other Marvel productions also returned as part of the film's multiverse story, which serves as
                a tribute to Fox's Marvel films. Filming began in May 2023 at Pinewood Studios in England, with
                additional filming in Norfolk, Los Angeles, and Bovingdon Studios. Production was suspended in July due
                to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, but resumed in November and wrapped in January 2024. The title was
                revealed a month later. Rob Simonsen composed the original score, while numerous artists were compiled
                for the soundtrack.</p>

            <p>Deadpool & Wolverine premiered on July 22, 2024, at the David H. Koch Theater in New York City, and was
                released across the United States on July 26 as part of Phase Five of the MCU. It has grossed $1.338
                billion worldwide, becoming the 20th-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing R-rated
                film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2024.</p>

            <h2>Plot</h2>

            <p>In 2018, after Wade Wilson uses Cable's time-travel device to prevent the death of his girlfriend Vanessa
                Carlysle, he travels from his universe, Earth-10005, to Earth-616 on the "Sacred Timeline",
                hoping to join that reality's Avengers. However, he is rejected by Happy Hogan and returns to his
                universe. Six years later, Wade has broken up with Vanessa, retired from being the masked mercenary
                Deadpool, and works as a used-car salesman with his friend and former X-Force member Peter Wisdom.</p>

            <p>During Wade's birthday party, the Time Variance Authority (TVA) captures him and takes him to Mr.
                Paradox, who explains that they are an organization outside of time that monitors the Sacred Timeline
                and wider multiverse, and offers Wade a future on Earth-616. Wade initially accepts, but when Paradox
                reveals that Wade's timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of its stabilizing "anchor
                being", Logan, and that he plans to use a "Time Ripper" device to accelerate this process, Wade
                steals his TemPad and uses it to travel to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save the timeline.
                When this fails, Wade travels the multiverse searching for a replacement alternate universe "variant" of
                Logan.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>Wade returns to the TVA with a Logan variant but is told by Paradox that an anchor being cannot be
                replaced, and that this variant is considered "the worst Wolverine" in the multiverse. When Wade deduces
                that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox sends Wade and Logan to the Void.
                Logan agrees to work with Wade when he claims that the TVA can change his timeline. Wade and Logan are
                captured alongside Johnny Storm and taken to Cassandra Nova, the powerful and sadistic twin sister of
                X-Men leader Charles Xavier. Cassandra, who made a deal with the TVA to oversee the Void, kills Johnny
                and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by Alioth, but the pair manages to escape.</p>

            <p>Logan and Wade meet a Deadpool variant called "Nicepool" who directs them towards a resistance group that
                has been fighting Cassandra. On the way, Wade accidentally admits that he is not certain about the TVA
                being able to fix Logan’s timeline, and the pair fight until both are left unconscious. They are found
                by the resistance group, consisting of Laura, Elektra, Blade, and Gambit. Wade proposes an alliance to
                fight Cassandra, and Laura convinces Logan, distraught over his reluctance that led to the death of his
                fellow X-Men, to join the cause. The resistance members distract Cassandra's henchmen while Wade and
                Logan block her powers by placing Juggernaut's helmet on her head. Cassandra is betrayed by her follower
                Pyro on behalf of Paradox, and almost dies until Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet. Cassandra
                heals herself and uses a Sling Ring to open a portal to Earth-10005, which Logan and Wade jump through.
            </p>

            <p>Cassandra learns about Paradox's Time Ripper from Pyro, kills him, and follows Logan and Wade to
                Earth-10005. There, she reveals her plan to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void. Cassandra
                summons an army of Deadpool variants, who kill Nicepool and battle Wade and Logan until Peter arrives
                and distracts them. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that while one of them could destroy the Time Ripper by
                disrupting its power flow, this would kill them, even with their healing powers. Wade and Logan destroy
                the Time Ripper together, killing Cassandra in the process, and are able to survive by sharing the
                burden. Paradox is arrested by the TVA's Hunter B-15, who congratulates Wade and Logan and says their
                actions have stopped Earth-10005 from deteriorating. Wade asks Hunter B-15 to save the resistance group
                from the Void and change the history of Logan's world. She explains that the latter is not possible
                because Logan's history is what led to him being a hero now, and allows Logan to stay in Wade's world.
                Wade invites Logan to meet his friends and, with encouragement from Logan, reconciles with Vanessa.</p>

                        Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson / Deadpool:
                        A wisecracking mercenary from Earth-10005 with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his
                        body
                        after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation to treat terminal cancer. Wade begins the
                        film retired from being Deadpool, no longer dating Vanessa, and working as a used car salesman.
                        Writer Rhett Reese described Deadpool as a fish-out-of water in the film, a lunatic dropped into
                        the
                        "sane world" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Though Reynolds said the audience did not
                        have to take Deadpool seriously, particularly with his fourth wall breaking and unreliable
                        narration, he wanted them to be invested in the other characters. Deadpool's opening dance
                        number
                        was performed by Nick Pauley, who is credited as "Dancepool". Reynolds also portrays the
                        variant Nicepool, who has no scars or healing factor, for which he is credited as "Gordon
                        Reynolds".

                        Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine:
                        A former member of the X-Men and a mutant with healing abilities, retractable claws, and an
                        adamantium-infused skeleton. This Wolverine is a variant from an alternative universe where he
                        let down its inhabitants. This, and the pairing with Deadpool, allowed Jackman to explore new
                        aspects of the character not developed in his prior appearances in 20th Century Fox's X-Men film
                        series. Jackman said Logan and Wade are opposites and have a "quarreling dynamic", while
                        director Shawn Levy said their relationship is affected by both characters being "haunted with
                        regret". To prepare for the role, Jackman began a vigorous workout routine that included eating
                        up to 8,000 calories a day. Jackman also portrays several other Wolverine variants in the film,
                        including: one possessing the character's comic book-accurate height of 5 feet 3 inches (160
                        cm),
                        with actor Luke Bennett serving as body double for this particular variant; Wolverine's gambling
                        alter-ego Patch, who wears an eyepatch and a white tuxedo; an Old Man Logan variant; a variant
                        being
                        crucified on a giant X, reminiscent of the cover of Uncanny X-Men #251; a variant wearing the
                        brown
                        and tan costume from comic book artist John Byrne who fights the Hulk, as the character did in
                        his
                        first appearance in the Incredible Hulk comics; and an Age of Apocalypse variant with "glam
                        rock-like" hair, one hand, and a black and red costume.

                        Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova:
                        A mutant in the Void with telekinetic and telepathic powers, who is the twin sister of Charles
                        Xavier. Corrin was excited to play a villain in the film as they had not
                        played many villainous roles before. Corrin took inspiration from Christoph Waltz's character
                        Hans Landa in the film Inglourious Basterds (2009), while Reynolds highlighted Corrin's
                        humanization
                        and the motivation of the character, comparing Cassandra's "mischief, danger,
                        unpredictability" to the energy of actor Gene Wilder. Reynolds and Levy explained Cassandra to
                        Corrin as someone who would endear and charm others to the point that "you are going to be best
                        friends for life" only to realize she could easily kill them. Corrin was interested in having a
                        physical transformation for the role but was told by the studio that this was not required for
                        the
                        character. Corrin also wanted to pay homage to Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy's performances
                        as Xavier in previous X-Men films, as well as be faithful to Cassandra's relationship with him
                        from
                        the comics.

                Returning Marvel characters, and actors who had previously portrayed them, form the resistance group in
                the Void: Dafne Keen as Laura / X-23, Logan's biological daughter, from Logan (2017); Jennifer
                Garner as Elektra Natchios, a skilled fighter who uses a pair of sai weapons, from Daredevil (2003) and
                Elektra (2005); Wesley Snipes as Eric Brooks / Blade, a half-vampire warrior, from New Line
                Cinema's Blade film trilogy (1998–2004); and Chris Evans as Johnny Storm / Human Torch, a member of the
                Fantastic Four who can control flames and set himself ablaze, from Tim Story's Fantastic Four duology
                (2005–2007). Additionally, Channing Tatum joins them as Remy LeBeau / Gambit, the character he was
                attached to portray in an unproduced Gambit film. Keen rewatched Logan to help prepare for her
                return as Laura after seven years, and was eager to explore an older version of the character who now
                has a better understanding and appreciation of what Logan went through in Logan. Snipes worked out
                to be "Blade-ready" for the film. After struggling with Reynolds's humor when the pair co-starred in
                Blade: Trinity (2004), Snipes said he finally understood it within the context of Deadpool & Wolverine
                which made it an enjoyable experience. Evans, who previously portrayed Steve Rogers / Captain
                America in the MCU (as referenced in Deadpool's dialogue in this film), said Marvel Studios was more
                relaxed about creating Johnny's costume, which is a rundown version due to the character living in the
                Void, compared to the process for the Fantastic Four films.

                The film features several variants of Deadpool, including: dog actor Peggy as Mary Puppins /
                Dogpool; Reynolds's wife Blake Lively as the voice of Ladypool, who is physically portrayed by
                stuntwoman Christiaan Bettridge; Reynolds and Lively's children Inez and Olin Reynolds as
                Kidpool and Babypool, respectively; Nathan Fillion as the voice of Headpool; Matthew
                McConaughey as the voice of Cowboypool; Wrexham A.F.C. player Paul Mullin as Welshpool;
                Reynolds's stunt double Alex Kyshkovych as Canadapool; an uncredited Harry Holland – brother of Tom
                Holland, who portrays Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the MCU – as Haroldpool; and Kevin Fortin and
                Hung Dante Dong, both also uncredited, as Zenpool and Watari / Roninpool, respectively. Deadpool
                variants played by undisclosed actors include Deadpool 2099, Golden Age Deadpool, Piratepool,
                Scottishpool, Shortpool, Kingpool, Cupidpool, Greatest Showman Deadpool, Jesterpool, Detectivepool, a
                hooded Deadpool and a Deadpool with white parts on his suit. The Greatest Showman
                Deadpool variant is a reference to Jackman's role as P.T. Barnum in the 2017 film The Greatest
                Showman.

                Jon Favreau reprises his MCU role of Harold "Happy" Hogan, along with Wunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15
                from the MCU television series Loki (2021–2023). Chris Hemsworth appears as Thor through repurposed
                archival footage from Thor: The Dark World (2013), while a variant of the Hulk appears fighting
                a variant of Wolverine. Cameo appearances include Henry Cavill as a Wolverine variant dubbed
                "Cavillrine", Wrexham A.F.C. player Ollie Palmer as a bar patron, Greg Hemphill as a
                bartender, and Reynolds's oldest daughter James as a screaming mutant. Reynolds's co-chairman of
                Wrexham, Rob McElhenney, filmed a cameo as a TVA soldier, but his appearance was ultimately cut. A
                Stanley Steemer advertisement featuring X-Men co-creator Stan Lee can be seen on a transit bus during
                the titular characters' battle with the Deadpool corps.

            <h3 id="backgroud">Background</h3>
            <p>
                After the success of Deadpool (2016), 20th Century Fox began developing two sequels. The third film was
                set to include the superhero team X-Force.[64] Deadpool director Tim Miller chose not to return for the
                sequels due to creative differences with star Ryan Reynolds, and David Leitch was hired to direct
                Deadpool 2 (2018) in November 2016. Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film.
                In March 2017, Deadpool and Deadpool 2 co-writer Rhett Reese said X-Force would be introduced in
                Deadpool 2 before starring in a planned spin-off film that would launch "something bigger", separate
                from the third Deadpool film, which would be more personal. When the acquisition of 21st Century Fox
                by Disney was announced in December 2017, the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Reynolds's Wade
                Wilson / Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This was despite those
                films being rated PG-13 and the Deadpool films being R-rated. Iger said Disney was willing to make
                R-rated Deadpool films "as long as we let the audiences know what's coming" and said a "Marvel-R brand"
                could be created for characters like Deadpool. In May 2018, Reynolds said a third Deadpool film may
                not be made due to the shift of focus to X-Force. Reese and his writing partner Paul Wernick said a
                third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X-Force film was
                released, similar to the MCU crossover film The Avengers (2012) being released between Iron Man 2 (2010)
                and Iron Man 3 (2013).
            </p>

            <p>
                At the end of May 2018, Leitch expressed interest in returning for another Deadpool film, depending on
                the schedule. A third Deadpool film was believed to be in active development by that August, with
                production planned to take place in Atlanta, Georgia, rather than in Vancouver, Canada, where the
                previous films were made. Once Upon a Deadpool, a PG-13 version of Deadpool 2, was released at the
                end of the year. It was watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see how it might inform their
                approach to the character in the MCU. While promoting Once Upon a Deadpool, Reynolds confirmed that
                a third Deadpool film was in development and said it would go in a "completely different direction".
                Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a road trip film styled after Rashomon (1950)
                featuring Hugh Jackman's X-Men film series character Logan / Wolverine. Karan Soni, who portrayed
                Dopinder in the first two Deadpool films, reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have
                focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole. Jackman had
                himself envisioned a team-up film with Reynolds inspired by 48 Hrs. (1982) while attending a screening
                of Deadpool in 2016, but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after Logan (2017). In March
                2019, Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for
                Marvel Studios, including Deadpool and the X-Men. The Marvel-based films that Fox had been
                developing were placed "on hold".
            </p>

            <p>
                Josh Brolin, who portrayed Cable in Deadpool 2 and Thanos in the MCU, said in June 2019 that he had
                discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios. In October, Zazie Beetz said she would be
                surprised if she did not reprise her Deadpool 2 role of Domino in a future film. That month, Reese
                and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a "much-needed rest from Deadpool" while they waited to
                hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise's future. They confirmed that another Deadpool film would
                be made, that it would be R-rated like the previous films, and that it would integrate the character
                with the MCU. Wernick said there was never a set pitch for a third Deadpool film between their
                exhaustion following Deadpool 2 and the announcement of Fox's acquisition by Disney. Reese said they now
                had to "land on the right idea and once we do, I think we'll be off to the races". The writers felt
                there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their
                restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films.

            <p>
                Reynolds revealed in mid-October 2019 that he was meeting with Marvel Studios. At that time, Marvel
                Studios president Kevin Feige was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking
                about how the X-Men and mutants in general would be added to the franchise. Feige described Reynolds as
                an "idea machine" who pitched many different approaches for the film, including a low budget road
                trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the Sundance Film
                Festival, and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to "I Guess That's Why They Call It
                the Blues" by Elton John. Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a Rashomon–style team-up film
                with Wolverine, which would tell one story from three different perspectives. He was told that it
                would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film. In December, Reynolds confirmed that the
                "whole team" was actively developing a Deadpool film at Marvel Studios.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October 2020, including Wendy Molyneux
                and Lizzie Molyneux-Logelin whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film. The Molyneux
                sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month. Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to
                Leitch returning for the film, but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout 2021 and
                was not involved in hiring the writers. Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film,
                but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning.
                In January 2021, Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU.
                Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time, and Feige said filming would not begin
                until after 2021 due to Reynolds's busy schedule. An idea that Reynolds had in 2020 or 2021 was an
                action sequence set to the song "Like a Prayer" by Madonna. It was intended to follow the death of Piotr
                Rasputin / Colossus from the previous films, which would have motivated Deadpool after being at a low
                point.
            </p>

            <p>
                While filming The Adam Project (2022) with director Shawn Levy, Reynolds approached Levy about working
                together on the next Deadpool film after they had become frequent collaborators. Reynolds assumed Levy
                would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work, but Levy was enthused about
                the idea as long as they had the right story to tell. In July 2021, Reynolds and Taika Waititi
                promoted their film Free Guy (2021), also directed by Levy, by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi's MCU
                character Korg, respectively, in a commercial for that film titled Deadpool and Korg React. Deadpool,
                who often breaks the fourth wall, discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial. The
                next month, Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in 2022, which Feige soon confirmed. Feige
                added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film. In November, Beetz and Rob
                Delaney expressed interest in returning as their Deadpool 2 characters Domino and Peter Wisdom,
                but Beetz ultimately did not return for the third film. Also in November, Reynolds said they were
                "plugging away" at the film.
            </p>

            <p>
                Levy was revealed to be directing the film in March 2022, and said filming would not begin
                until after 2022 due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year. Reese and Wernick were
                hired to rewrite the screenplay, and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film.
                They added that Disney and Marvel were supportive of jokes about the MCU that they were writing for
                Deadpool given the success of the previous films. They would not confirm whether they were starting from
                scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters. In June, Raymond Chan was revealed
                to be the production designer after working on the Disney+ MCU series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
                (2021). Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to
                other third installments of MCU film series, such as Captain America: Civil War (2016), Thor: Ragnarok
                (2017), and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).
            </p>

            <p>
                Levy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese, Wernick, and Zeb Wells, who previously worked on
                the MCU series She-Hulk: Attorney at Law (2022) and Marvel Zombies (2024), and the film The Marvels
                (2023). They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not
                derivative of the other Deadpool films. Levy explained that they felt the film had to be "deserving" of
                being the first Deadpool film set within the MCU, while still feeling "grounded because this is an
                earthbound, gritty, realistic superhero franchise". Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige
                that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea,
                with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea
                for the film. In August 2022, Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film.
                Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story
                ideas, and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up
                against. Jackman had a change of heart, after being content with his decision to retire as
                Wolverine for several years, and decided that a team-up film with Reynolds "could be so much fun; I'll
                probably have more fun on that movie than anything I've ever done". Feige advised Jackman not to
                return, as he felt Wolverine's death in Logan was the "greatest ending in history" and did not want to
                undo that. He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine, and
                Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reynolds announced in September 2022 that Jackman would return as Wolverine for Deadpool 3, which was
                set for release on September 6, 2024. The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of
                Logan by using a narrative device from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to
                move around timelines. Levy said preserving Logan's legacy was top priority for the creative
                team. Jackman reached out to Logan director James Mangold to inform him of the film's story and said
                Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that Logan would not be impacted.
                Alongside Feige, Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies
                Maximum Effort and 21 Laps Entertainment, as did X-Men film producer Lauren Shuler
                Donner. Simon Kinberg served as an executive producer after producing the previous Deadpool films
                and some X-Men films. He said the film had been authored by Levy, Reynolds, and Feige,
                and they all cared deeply about Logan, Deadpool, and Wolverine. Levy added that the legacies of
                Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film's story and themes. Jackman said the film may not be titled
                Deadpool 3, with Reynolds later referring to it as "The Deadpool/Wolverine film", and Jackman
                referring to it as Wolverine and Deadpool. Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple
                options for the title, and he had at times referred to it as Deadpool Versus Wolverine, Deadpool and
                Wolverine, and Deadpool 3 with Wolverine. The title Deadpool & Friend, which Reynolds claimed was
                the official title, leaked online in February 2024. After a negative fan response to the title, a
                different title was officially announced the next day: Deadpool & Wolverine. Levy acknowledged
                that the film was the third Deadpool film but he did not want to call it Deadpool 3 because it is a
                "two-hander character adventure" that focuses on both title characters. Despite this, Reynolds said
                the film was tonally still a Deadpool film, with violence, swearing, and "meta mayhem". He called it
                "the most Deadpool movie in the history of Deadpool".

                Rob Simonsen was hired to compose the film's score by mid-July 2023. He previously worked with Levy on
                The Adam Project (2022) and the fourth season of Stranger Things. The soundtrack album, also known
                as Deadpool & Wolverine: Van Jamz, was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 24, 2024, with a
